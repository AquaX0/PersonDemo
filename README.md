approach: because i wanted to add something like pronouns in the code, i decided to make an introduction part and decided a errorhandling part if the age is set to negative or zero

challenges: there are some challenges i faced in this project, how to put the person class into the code and how to make the error handling for each information. When i gave chatgpt how to put the person class into the code, chatgpt showed me that i have to delete the public part and chatgpt also procedeed to add the error handling for the age, gender, and name. When i saw the error handling for the age and gender i decided to add that into the hobby part too, but i also didn;t like the error handling they made for the age part. So i procedeed to change the error handling for the age part so that if it's negative or zero, it will be set to "Unknown". But i didn't know how to make it into a string back so chatgpt gave me the solution as you can see in my code

the program: when you run the program, the program will print the information of each person you have made in the code. Then prints a greeting for the odd numbered peerson and a introduction for the even numbered person.
