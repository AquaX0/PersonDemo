# Approach/Design
My class consists of the variables name, age, gender, and hobby with a greeting and introduction part

# Challenges
There are some challenges i faced in this project, how to make the error handling for each information. First i asked chatgpt how to make the error handling, chatgpt added an error handling for the age, gender, and name. When i saw the error handling for the age and gender i decided to add that into the hobby part too, but i also didn;t like the error handling they made for the age part. So i procedeed to change the error handling for the age part so that if it's negative or zero, it will be set to "Unknown". But i didn't know how to make it into a string back so chatgpt gave me the solution as you can see in my code

# How it works
When you run the program, the program will print the information of each person you have made in the code. Then prints a greeting for the odd numbered person and a introduction for the even numbered person.

# Reflection (What I Learnt)
i learned how to make a structured class that is put in a different file for java and how to make a constructor
